# Project Portfolio

Welcome to my project portfolio! Below, you'll find an overview of some of the key projects I've worked on, each showcasing different skills and technologies. Whether it's developing software, designing interfaces, or working with robotics, these projects represent a broad range of my interests and capabilities.

### 1. **TDoA Positioning**
   - **How does it work?**  
     This project dives into the world of Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA) technology. I implemented a system to pinpoint the location of a tag by analyzing signals sent from multiple anchors. By comparing the time it takes for signals to reach the tag from different points, the system can accurately determine its position. It's a practical demonstration of how TDoA can be used in real-world positioning systems.

### 2. **Robot Cell Calibration**
   - **Why is it important?**  
     Working with mobile robots in manufacturing settings, I focused on calibrating camera systems for precise operations. This project involved calculating the exact positions where a robot should grip components, which is crucial for avoiding collisions and ensuring smooth, autonomous operation. By improving calibration accuracy, the robots can now work more reliably in their designated spaces.

### 3. **Robot Car Navigation**
   - **What does it do?**  
     For this project, I developed an algorithm to navigate a robot car, using the Kalman filter for precise movement and position estimation. The control system, which I implemented on a Raspberry Pi, communicates securely with various sensors via SSH. This project was all about ensuring the robot could move accurately and efficiently in real-time, making it a practical application of both statistical analysis and robotics.

### 4. **Quadrocopter GUI**
   - **What did I build?**  
     I designed a user-friendly graphical interface for controlling the Tello Edu quadrotor. This isn't just any interfaceâ€”it displays real-time data from the quadrotor's sensors, including ultrasonic readings, barometric pressure, LED status, and even visual data from the camera. This project really brought the quadrotor's capabilities to life, making it easier and more intuitive to pilot and monitor remotely.

### 5. **Data Tracker (C++)**
   - **What's it about?**  
     This project was part of a school assignment where I created a simple yet powerful expense tracking system using C++. The goal was to manage personal finances efficiently, all while applying Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts like classes and inheritance. The end result is a flexible tool that helps users keep track of their spending, all neatly coded in C++.
